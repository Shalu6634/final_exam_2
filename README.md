Description:-
This is a simple Task Management App built using Flutter, SQLite, and Firebase. The app allows users to:

Create, update, delete, and categorize tasks.
Sync tasks with Firebase for cloud backup and real-time synchronization across devices.

Features Local storage with SQLite:
Tasks are stored locally on the device using SQLite, allowing for offline access and efficient data management.
Cloud synchronization with Firebase: Tasks are automatically backed up to Firebase Firestore, ensuring data is synced across multiple devices and securely stored in the cloud.
Task categorization: Users can categorize tasks (e.g., Work, Personal, Shopping) to keep tasks organized.
Task completion: Users can mark tasks as completed or pending.
Cross-platform: The app works on both Android and iOS.
